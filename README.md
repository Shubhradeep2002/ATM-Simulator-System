# ATM-Simulator-System
In this Project I have simulated an ATM locally using Java for interface creation & MySQL for database creation. 
It consists of all main features available in an ATM like Depositing money, withdrawing money, viewing bank balance,
printing mini statement.
It is gives a brief idea about how financial transactions actually work in an ATM.
